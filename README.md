# starship-directory
Vue/Vuex exercise for the IT Academy bootcamp. <br/> 
The app fetches data from swapi.py4e.com and displays a list of Star Wars starships (accesible only when the user is logged in). <br/>
Selecting a starship displays some of its characteristics and a picture (if available). <br/> 
If the starship has known pilots, the app also gives data about them hovering over their pictures (app is only for desktop).<br/>

## testing
The exercise also required the use of testing for at least two components. <br/>
You can find the tests for Navigation and Pilot Card in the `tests/unit/` directory. You can run them after cloning the repo: 
```
npm run test:unit
```
